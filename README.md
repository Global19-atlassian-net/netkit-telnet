netkit-telnet
=============

This is https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/netkit-telnet , with some
bugfixes.

*Note:* Besides `netkit-telnet`, there's also a `netkit-telnet-ssl` package,
that only differs in the fact that the later adds an argument if you want to
make a telnet connection over SSL. The version on my fork (with the bugfixes)
for `netkit-telnet-ssl` also exists, and is updated quite more often.
